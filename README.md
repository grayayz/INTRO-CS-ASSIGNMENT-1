# Introduction to Computer Science – Assignment 1

**Author:** Janine Al-Zahiri  

This repository contains the 3 parts of my first assignment in Introduction to Computer Science.

---

## 1. Welcome Program

**File:** `Welcome.java`  

**Description:**  
Basic Java program that displays:
Welcome to CS111.

## 2. Palindrome Program

**File:** `Palindrome.java`  

**Description:**  
A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards.  

For example:
6 3 2 2 3 6

is a palindrome.  

In this program:

- User inputs **6 command-line arguments** (must be integers).  
- The program will tell you if the sequence is a palindrome (`true`) or not (`false`).

## 3. Gravitational Force Program

**File:** `GravitationalForce.java`  

**Description:**  
User inputs:

1. First mass (`m1`)  
2. Second mass (`m2`)  
3. Distance between them (`r`)  

The program will output the **gravitational force** between the masses using **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**:

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

Where `G = 6.6743 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²`.
