This repository contains the 3 parts of my first assignment in Introduction to Computer Science.
AUTHOR: Janine Al-Zahiri
-Welcome.java: Basic Java program that displays "Welcome to CS111."
-Palindrome.java: A palindrome is a sequence of characters that read the same backwards and forwards. For example: "6 3 2 2 3 6" is a palindrome. In this program,
user inputs 6 command-line arguments (must be integers), and the program will tell you if its a palindrome or not.
-GravitationalForce.java: User inputs first mass (m1), second mass (m2), and the distance between them (r). Program will output the gravitational force between them using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
